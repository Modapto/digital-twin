# MODAPTO Component "Digital Twin"

This component is based on FA続ST Service (branch `MODAPTO/submodel-template-processor`) and extends it with a custom submodel template (SMT) processor for handling SMTs of type Simulation, i.e., containing FMUs.

This repository creates a docker image containing both components in a single container including a default configuration file enabled the SMT processor.
The container can be used and configured the same as the regular FA続ST Service container at https://hub.docker.com/r/fraunhoferiosb/faaast-service.
For details, see the FA続ST Service documentation https://faaast-service.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

## Building
This project includes a `make` file supporting the following goal

- `build` builds the FA続ST Service & faaast-smt-smiulation-processor and puts the resulting JAR files in `/target`
- `docker` Requires `build` to be run first. Builds a local docker image named `ghcr.io/modapto/digital-twin:latest`.
- `publish` Requires `build` and `docker` to be run first. Publishes the docker image to the Github docker registry.
